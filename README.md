Inventory Tracker
Overview

The Inventory Tracker is a web-based application designed to help users easily manage and monitor their inventory items. It allows adding, editing, deleting, and filtering items. The app also saves inventory data in the browser using local storage, so your data remains even after refreshing the page.

Features

Add Items – Users can add new items with a name, quantity, and category.
Edit Quantities – Quantities can be modified directly from the table without reloading the page.
Delete Items – Items can be removed from the list easily.
Filter Items – Search items by name or category using the filter section.
Persistent Storage – Inventory data is automatically saved using Local Storage, ensuring that all data remains intact even after closing or refreshing the page.
Responsive Layout – Clean, user-friendly interface designed with HTML and CSS.
