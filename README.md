Project Name

INVENTORY TRACKER

Project Overview

The Inventory Tracker is a simple web-based application that helps users manage and monitor their inventory items efficiently. Users can add, view, and delete items directly from the interface, making it easy to keep track of stock levels and item details.

Features

Add new inventory items (name, quantity, and category).
View all current inventory items in a list.
Delete items once they are no longer needed.
(Optional) Persistent storage using localStorage.

Tech Stack

HTML for structure
CSS for styling
JavaScript for interactivity and data handling
Git & GitHub for version control

How It Works

User enters an item’s name, quantity, and category in a form.
The app dynamically displays all items below the form.
Each item can be deleted individually.
(Planned) Items will be saved automatically in localStorage for persistence.

Future Improvements

Add edit/update functionality for inventory items.
Add search and filter features.
Improve styling and responsiveness for mobile devices.
